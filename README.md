# SFML PROJECTs

All SFML ( Simple and Fast Media Library ) Projects that I created while learning it...

The `main` branch contains the project I am currently working on and other `branches` contain my completed projects.

### How to Run a Project 

To run a particular project, switch to that branch and execute following command in a linux terminal.

```
./run main.cpp
```

### Dependencies

Since it is SFML projects repository, you need to install `SFML` dependencies for your system. You can follow the guide from [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/).
